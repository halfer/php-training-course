1a. Retry Pandoc as	HTML renderer now DOMPDF is working
1b. Retry wkhtmltopdf as HTML renderer now DOMPDF is working
2. Can we apply smart quotes to ordinary quotes automatically in pandoc?
3. Add git rev number and date in footer
4. See if we can avoid having a bullet on its own:

DOMPDF does not support JS, but wkhtmltopdf does not support much in the way of page breaks. I'll live with
this very minor issue for the time being.

Problems with DOMPDF renderer

1. Heading bookmarks do not appear to be supported by DOMPDF:

2. Add footer containing page number:

3. Inline spans and code do not handle padding and margins correctly. I've added a workaround in the
stylesheet using top and bottom borders:

4. An unordered list item split over a page gets a bullet mark on the next page. Already raised here:

	https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/issues/683

This doesn't currently affect this project since I'm avoiding a page break inside list items.

5. I've not tried line-level orphan control yet, so if this comes up as a problem, I should add it to see
if it helps.

1. Can we keep a paragraph together with its following unordered list?
2. Is it possible to remove author/date details from PDF bookmarks?
3. Footers need more top margin
4. Footers should be in serif font, but appear to be in sans serif
