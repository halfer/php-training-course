1. See also paragraph keep-together (or orphan control) noted in styles.css
2. Is it possible to remove author/date details from PDF bookmarks?
3. Can we apply smart quotes to ordinary quotes automatically in pandoc?
4. Footers need more top margin
5. Footers should be in serif font, but appear to be in sans serif
