Here are a few conventions that authors should stick to for this work.

- Titles should be written in sentence case, not title case
- Inline code should be formatted using `My inline code`{.code}
- Block code should be formatted using ~~~ (using tab/space indents on their own sometimes causes random paragraphs in unordered lists)
- Bullet points should have no trailing full stop. On the occasions they are comprised of more than one sentence, only the last sentence should omit the full stop
- Links should be hyperlinked, but without the default http:// prefix. Links that use SSL should be prefixed with https://.
