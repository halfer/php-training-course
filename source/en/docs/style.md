Style
--

Notes:

* Beginners should not worry too greatly about adhering to a style guide, but know that code consistency affects readability greatly in large projects

Objectives:

* Be aware that giving variables and functions a readable and meaningful name will make things easier as your programs get more complicated
* Remember to always comment code that needs explanation, but try to write your code so that it does not need explanation!
* Understand the different brace conventions (same line versus next)
* Understand the different indent conventions (2 versus 4 and tab versus space)
* There are several notable “style guides”, in particular PSR-1/2 and PEAR

Resources:

* The PSR guidelines: [php-fig.org/psr/1/] and [php-fig.org/psr/2/]
* The PEAR guidelines: [pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php]
