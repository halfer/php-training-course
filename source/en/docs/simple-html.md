Simple HTML
--

Objectives:

* Understand that HTML is a document description language, rather than a programming language, and that it is often referred to as “markup” rather than “code”
* Be aware that HTML documents have a doctype, and that all new applications should generally use the HTML5 type (i.e.`<!DOCTYPE html>`{.code})
* Be conversant with some simple types: `<html>`{.code}, `<head>`{.code}, `<title>`{.code}, `<body>`{.code}, `<h1>`{.code}, `<p>`{.code}, `<a href>`{.code} and `<br />`{.code}.
* Appreciate HTML as being comprised of blocks nested inside each other
* Write an HTML document that makes use of all of these tags, and display it in a web browser
