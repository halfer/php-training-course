Reusing HTML
--

Objectives:

* Learn how blocks of HTML can be included in another using require
* Create a static web page, and call it `include_main_1.php`{.filename}. Put in a paragraph of text to indicate that this is “File 1”, and do the same again for `include_main_2.php`{.filename}, with a paragraph labelling it as “File 2”
* Add a file containing a snippet of HTML, called `include_menu.php`{.filename}. In here, add links with suitable names to the two above files
* Add a suitable require PHP snippet prior to the paragraph in each “main” file, so that it all links together. You should now have a menu inserted at the top of each of your two pages
