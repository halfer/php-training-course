The array type
--

Objectives:

* Understand the purpose of an array as being a list of variables, and that it can be used for a broad range of list types, such as menu entries, shopping cart contents, database results etc.
* Be able to explain the difference between an associative and an indexed array
* Write a program (`array_set.php`{.filename}) to insert a set of items into specific array positions (e.g. four kinds of fruit, five types of weather, or whatever set you choose)
* Modify the last program to use the `[]`{.code} operator, to add items to the end of an array
* Understand the use of debugging commands `print_r()`{.code} and `var_dump()`{.code} to see what is inside an array
* Write a program (`array_assoc.php`{.filename}) to insert a set of key-value pairs into an associative array (e.g. the attributes of a bicycle, such as [`colour => silver`{.code}, `frame => mountain bike`{.code}, `brakes => hydraulic`{.code}, `wheels => 2`{.code}], or whatever topic you like)
