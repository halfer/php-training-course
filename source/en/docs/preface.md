About the course
--

Welcome to the course! This course aims to teach attendees basic programming concepts, using the widely available PHP language and MySQL database server. Programming can be used for a lot of things, but we'll focus just on one: building applications for the web. The skills you will learn will teach you to think like a programmer, and so will be very useful if you decide to learn another language.

The course will be hands-on, so bring a laptop (netbooks are okay but might be impractical for the amount of typing we'll be doing). The software we will install will run on pretty much any operating system (if you wish to install before your first lesson, WAMP for Windows or MAMP for Macs is suitable – Linux users probably have everything they need already). You may need to ensure you have administrator rights on the laptop (if it is a work computer, it may be locked down so software cannot be installed).

About the format
--

We'll have a number of objectives to try each week, which we'll work on together. The material will roughly run in order, so we can later look at complex topics that draw earlier, simple ones together. However, occasionally we might need to make use of something we've not yet learnt; this is okay, as we'll cover everything eventually.

If you miss a week, you may find it helpful to refer to the notes and do some internet research to cover the objectives for that week. We can always use some time after class for catch-up sessions if necessary. Get in touch by email throughout the week if you would like to see how far we got in a particular week.

Attendees are welcome to ask questions at any time, and helping each other is encouraged. If some feature of the course could be changed to make it easier for you to learn, let me know. While these notes will form a rough plan for each week, if attendees wish to cover other material, we'll try to cover that also.

The main aim of this course is that it will be interesting, fun and encourage you to experiment with technology. As with many things, there is no end point where one can stop learning – if you can find the time for additional hacking, there's plenty of tutorials on the web.

Code examples

There are a lot of exercises in this course, as the process of typing can really aid the memorisation of the material. In each case, a suitable file name is suggested, so that items are easy to look up. This will be helpful on the occasions when one exercise builds upon another one.
