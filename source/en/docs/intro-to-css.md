Introduction to CSS
--

Notes:

* Front-end design is not the aim of this course, so this section is deliberately simple. If you want to learn more about this, there's a great range of online and book resources

Objectives:

* Understand the purpose of CSS as “separating style from content” - content is easier to maintain, global style changes are trivial, and content is less cluttered with style attributes
* Learn how to create an inline stylesheet (using `style`{.code} with `type`{.code})
* Discover the purpose of ids, classes, and CSS keywords `border`{.code}, `font-family`{.code}, `font-weight`{.code}, `font-style`{.code}, `color`{.code}, `background-color`{.code}, `margin`{.code} and `padding`{.code}
* Learn how to create an external stylesheet (using `link`{.code} with `href`{.code}) and understand why this is a good idea
* Modify `include_menu.php`{.filename} so that it contains an inline stylesheet, and give the menu a red border, a pink background, and an emboldened font. Add some margin and padding too, so it is nicely spaced out	
* Modify `include_menu.php`{.filename} so that the inline stylesheet is converted to an external asset
