For loops
--

Objectives:

* Understand how to loop through a section of code, and that each loop run is known as an “iteration”
* Write a web-based program (`for_magic.php`{.code}) to echo a magic word of your choosing three times, using a `for`{.code} loop, from one to three
* Modify your program so that the magic word indicates which iteration count it is on, for example:

~~~~
Hocus pocus number 1
~~~~

* Be aware of the tradition of using loop variables starting from `$i`{.code}, but don't use them if a clearer name would be better
