* Understand the purpose of the web server, in basic terms
* Know there are several different “brands” of server, that Apache httpd is by far the most popular, powering around 52% of the web, followed by Microsoft IIS at 20%
* Understanding that HTML documents are rendered by the browser
* Create a simple HTML document (`simple.html`{.filename}) and load it into the browser via the file system
* Load the HTML document via the web server (and see that it looks the same)
* Create a simple PHP script (`simple.php`{.filename}) and load it via the file system (and understand why raw PHP code is seen)
* Load the PHP script via the web server (and see that it has been processed into HTML)
* Understand that the most dynamic web pages are rendered using a process similar to this, regardless of the programming language used
