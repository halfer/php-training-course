Introduction to code
--

Objectives:

* Understand that PHP programs can be written in a simple text-editor, but that word-processors and desktop publishing packages are generally unsuitable
* Know that programs are executed line by line, in order, except where statements are used to change the order
* Understand the purpose of the open tag `<php`{.code}, the close tag `?>`{.code}, and the semi-colon line separator
* Look at a sample of PHP code from the internet, and see that braces `{}`{.code} are used a lot
* Be aware that indentation and commenting are valuable aids to readability, and that getting this right from the start of a project will save time later on

Resources:

* Here's some publicly available PHP code written by Facebook engineers: <https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk/blob/master/src/facebook.php>
