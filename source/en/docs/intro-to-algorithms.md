Introduction to algorithms
--

Objectives:

* Understand that an algorithm is a plan for a program, independent of programming language
* Using a text editor (or pencil and paper) note down how you would determine the largest value from a randomly-ordered array of numbers. Don't write your answer in code to start with â€“ the idea here is to work out the plan, not what to type
* Write this program, calling the file `algorithm_max.php`{.code}. Include at the start an array containing around eight numeric values in a random order
