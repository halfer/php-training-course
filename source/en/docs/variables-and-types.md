Variables and types
--

Objectives:

* Understand the purpose of a variable in a computer program
* Be aware what characters are considered valid for a variable name
* Be aware that there is a string type and two numeric types, integer and float, for whole and fractional numbers respectively
* Know that most types in PHP are not explicitly stated, and that this is known as “weakly typed” (in contrast to “strongly typed” languages)
* Understand how to join strings together using the dot operator (“concatenation”)
* Write a program (`variables_hello.php`) to store your name and render the following string in an HTML document or a console program:

		Hello <name>, how are you?

* Write a program (`variables_calc.php`) to store three numbers (either integers or floats) in variables, store the result of a mathematical operation of your choice that involves them all, output all the numbers, and the result. Example:

		My calculation is 1.5 + 4 / 2 and the result is 3.5

* Modify `variables_calc.php` so that, rather than using the dot operator, you use some inline variables
