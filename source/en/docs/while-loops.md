While loops
--

Objectives:

* Understand the purpose of a while loop
* In addition to the `==`{.code} test from the if exercise, learn new comparison expressions `>`{.code}, `<`{.code}, `>=`{.code}, `<=`{.code} and `!`{.code}
* Write a web program (`while_loop.php`{.filename}) featuring a while loop to count backwards from 10 to 1
* Modify your program so that one half of the bullet points are italicised (you choose which half). Remember that `<em>`{.code} is an inline tag, so needs to go inside `<li>`{.code}. Hint: you'll need two if statements for this
