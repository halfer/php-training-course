Using an IDE

Objectives:

* Learn the difference between text editors, programmers' editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
* Install the NetBeans IDE and create a project that points at the root folder of your web server
* Be aware that there are many editors of different kinds, and what you use is mainly a matter of personal taste
* Look at examples of syntax colouration, code folding and auto-completion
* Choose between using your new IDE (lots of features) or sticking with a text editor (nothing new to learn)

Resources:
