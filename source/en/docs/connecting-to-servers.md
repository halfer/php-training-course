Connecting to servers
--

Notes:

* You will need access to a Linux or Unix SSH/telnet account for this section. Obtain connection details from your instructor
* The whole class will be given the same connection details so be sure to modify different files
* If you are on Windows, download the “PuTTY” terminal client; Mac and Linux users will already have a console client installed

Objectives:

* Understand that, once you are connected to your remote server, you are issuing commands on that server, not locally
* Be aware that connecting to the remote console is useful for configuration, deployment and debugging
* Use the `nano`{.code} editor to create and edit a simple PHP console program. The program should five different types of food, each one on its own line, preceded by an asterisk
* Know how to save and exit inside nano
* Run your console program to see its output on the remote server
* Use the `ls`{.code} command to see the files that your peers have created
