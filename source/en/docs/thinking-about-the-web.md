Thinking about the web
--

Objectives:

* Develop an awareness of constantly thinking about what problems might be solved online. Is there an untapped niche, or could something be done better?
* Suggest in class, or write down, some ideas for how you can harness the web. Ideas may come from professional experiences, personal interests and hobbies, anything
* Ideas may turn into a business, solve a social problem, be for the common good or be just to tinker with a technology
* Know that sketching and "wire-framing" can help stimulate ideas
* Simple hosting costs a cup of coffee every month, so hobbyists can afford a "play box"
