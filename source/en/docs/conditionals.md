Objectives:

* Understand how if constructs are used to help the computer make decisions
* Write a web program (`if.php`{.filename}) to read a query string called “name” via the `$_GET`{.code} array (we'll learn much more about these later on)
* Modify the program to test whether the “name” parameter is equal to a particular string value (such as your own name), using the equality `==`{.code} operator
* Understand that string comparisons are case-sensitive
* Modify the program to accept a number value, such as “number_of_cats_owned”, and perform a numeric equality comparison
* Add in an `else`{.code} clause to one or both of your `if`{.code} statements
