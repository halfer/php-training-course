Coding challenge: “Fizz buzz”
--

Notes:

* For this exercise, you'll find the modulo operator `%`{.code} useful

Objectives:

* Code the number sequence for the Fizz Buzz game, from 1 to 100, as fizz_buzz.php. Here's how it works: people sit in a circle and the first person says the number 1. Each subsequent person adds 1 to the last number, and says the number, except if the number is exactly divisible by 3, in which case they say “Fizz”. They also do not say the number if it is divisible by 5, in which case they say “Buzz”. If the number is divisible by both numbers, they say “Fizz Buzz”.
* Improve the program by setting up an array of players' names, and at each iteration write out who said what. You can have as many players as you like, with whatever names you like. Example:

~~~~
Fred says 1

Polly says 2

William says Fizz

Fred says 4...
