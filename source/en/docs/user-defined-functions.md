User-defined functions
--

Objectives:

* Understand that blocks of code can be grouped into functions, which may have input values (parameters) and an output (a return value)
* See that using functions helps keep code organised (modularity) and means we can easily call it again without writing it again (code reuse)
* Modify your `algorithm_max.php`{.filename} program so that your maximum algorithm is written as a function
* Modify this program so the function is called on an additional numeric array of your choosing
